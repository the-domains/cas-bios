Brian Smith, Founder of the world famous UGG Australia
Brand.

Graduating in 1978 as a Chartered Accountant in Australia,
Brian came to California looking for the next big opportunity to bring back to
Australia.

While studying at the UCLA Graduate School of Management he
observed that there was no sheepskin footwear in the US.

With only $500 in capital, he imported boot samples and over
the next seventeen years built the UGG Australia brand into a multi-million
dollar international enterprise. He sold in 1995 and the brand has continued to
grow to exceed a billion dollars in annual sales for the past three years.

Brian is one of the most sought after International business
leaders in the country today. He is committed to teaching entrepreneurs how to
leverage their most precious assets from within, and to recognize and pursue
their passions to create a fulfilling and successful life.

Brian has authored the book "The Birth of a Brand --
Launching Your Entrepreneurial Passion and Soul", is a sought after Keynote
speaker and mentors small business owners.

He spends his time with his family and friends in Southern
California and enjoys surfing and contributing to humanity.
